# CLI-Store/Bamazon

  Bamazon is a CLI application that lets us create our own store. For this project, we created a sporting goods store. The customer/user is going to interact with the store using the terminal/command line and will be able to see the store's inventory, and also make purchases. We are using different technologies in this application, such as:

      * npm
      * Node.js
      * mySQL
      * DBeaver
      * Inquirer 
      * CLI-Table
      * MAMP
      
Now, we are going to use a few gifs to illustrate how our application works.

# Customer enters the store and decides to make a purchase

![purchase](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46465000/55370358-3f145400-54c8-11e9-9826-7a4b2ac00098.gif)

  In this gif we can see how the table of products is being displayed on the screen. The customer selects the item to be purchased using the item's ID, and then they select how many items they want to buy (quantity). Once that is done, the store tells the customer the total of the purchase and the inventory is shown again, this time with the updated items in stock.

# Customer enters the store and decides to make a purchase but there are not enough items in stock

![insuficient items](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46465000/55370497-a8946280-54c8-11e9-9fcd-0b0efaa981e2.gif)

  Here we can see how the customer decides to buy an item, selects the item but the quantity that they want to buy exceeds the items in stock. When this situation arises the program is not going to allow the customer to buy the items, and a new session will start allowing the customer to select a differen item, or change the quantity of their purchase.
  
# Customer enters the store, but decides not to make a purchase

  In this case our customer enters the store, but they decide not to make a purchase. They are going to select "Exit" which is going to take them out of the session and start a new one, so the customer can one more time decide if they want to make a purchase or not.
